Guide your users through a tour of your site, 100% free!

== Description ==

No one likes the frustration of learning something new, or the pain when a familiar interface changes underneath them.  A tour can be a powerful tool in sharing your features and interface details with your users in a friendly, interactive way.

Shepherd is designed to not only be the most user-friendly tour tool, it's also the easiest to use.  Simply pick where you'd like the messages to appear, when it should appear and what you'd like to say.  We handle showing the steps, keeping track of repeat visitors, and all the advanced positioning magic necessary to keep your messages looking great on every device.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin and activate it. You will be taken to the plugin's settings page, where you can customize and complete your installation.

== Screenshots ==

Shepherd is a plugin available on Eager, and through this plugin, on Wordpress. Eager allows Shepherd to provide a powerful preview experience which we think you'll love.

= Why do you install two plugins? =

We install both the Shepherd plugin, and the universal Eager plugin. The universal plugin gives you all the power of the Eager Live Preview technology. We could bundle it with the Shepherd plugin, but we install it seperately to ensure that you don't accidentally remove any other Eager plugins should you decide to remove Shepherd someday (but why would you?!).

All configuration can be done inside this Wordpress plugin, there is no need to visit Eager.
